<p>Whether you live near the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, the Black Hills of South Dakota or the Tetons of Idaho and Wyoming, mountains make the world more beautiful and interesting. Theyâ€™re fun to hike and they offer a haven for many animals and birds. During war, people have often fled to the mountains for safety and refuge.
